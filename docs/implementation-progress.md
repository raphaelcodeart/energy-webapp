# Implementation Progress

Updated at the end of each work session. This is the authoritative "what's actually
done vs. planned" record — `architecture.md` describes the target, this file describes
reality.

## Session 1 — 2026-07-25

### Phase A — Analysis & documentation ✅
- [x] Repository analysis (repo was empty — greenfield build, no existing stack,
      no `Allegato_A_Piano_Carriera_Regolamento_Provvigionale.pdf`)
- [x] `docs/architecture.md`, `docs/database-model.md` (+ ER diagram),
      `docs/business-rules.md`, `docs/commission-engine-specification.md`,
      `docs/open-questions.md`, `docs/security-model.md`, `docs/network-model.md`,
      `docs/ai-architecture.md` (design only), `docs/deployment.md`,
      `docs/adr/0001..0005`

### Phase B/C/D/E — Vertical slice ✅ (verified working end-to-end)

**Monorepo & infra**
- [x] pnpm workspace (`apps/api`, `apps/dashboard`; `apps/worker` shares the api image)
- [x] `docker-compose.dev.yml` (postgres, redis, minio, api, celery-worker,
      celery-beat, dashboard, nginx) — YAML-validated; not run under real Docker in
      this sandbox (no Docker daemon available), see "Verification method" below
- [x] `docker-compose.production.yml`, multi-stage `Dockerfile`s (non-root users,
      healthchecks) for api and dashboard
- [x] `.env.example`, `.gitignore`, `scripts/{deploy,backup,restore,health-check,migrate,rollback}.sh`

**Backend (FastAPI, verified against a real local Postgres 18 instance)**
- [x] `auth`: Argon2id hashing, JWT access tokens, rotating refresh tokens in a
      `sessions` table, single/all-session revocation, account lockout, identical
      error message for unknown-email vs wrong-password (enumeration mitigation)
- [x] `organizations`, `users`, `rbac` (roles/permissions/ABAC-ready), `audit`
      (append-only)
- [x] `network`: `agent_profiles`, `network_nodes`, `network_edges`,
      `network_closure` (with reflexive rows + composite indexes),
      `network_assignment_history`, `network_snapshots`/`network_snapshot_nodes`;
      transactional `move_agent()` (cycle prevention, whole-subtree relocation,
      closure table maintenance) and `create_snapshot_for_contract()`
- [x] `referral`: promoter codes, referral events/sessions (hashed cookie tokens),
      customer attribution
- [x] `catalog`, `customers`, `contracts`: explicit state machine
      (`state_machine.py`, `assert_transition_allowed`), status history, ownership
      link (`customers.user_id`) for customer self-service
- [x] `outbox`: transactional outbox table + dispatcher (ADR 0005) — commission
      calculation triggers only on `ContractActivated`/`ContractRenewed`, never on
      creation/submission
- [x] `commissions`: pure-function calculator (`calculators/entrepreneurial_difference.py`),
      isolated 33%-rule policy (`policies/branch_cap.py`), orchestration service with
      idempotency (`(contract_id, trigger_event_id)` + unique `idempotency_key`),
      append-only `commission_movements` ledger, read-only simulator
- [x] Ownership-scoped endpoints: `GET /contracts/mine` (customer), `GET /network/mine`
      + `GET /network/agents/{id}/branch` (promoter, ABAC-checked against the
      closure table), `GET /commissions/mine`
- [x] Celery app (`app/celery_app.py`) reusing the same domain code; beat schedule
      polls the outbox every minute

**Database**
- [x] Alembic migration `0001_initial_schema` — 43 tables, generated via
      autogenerate and applied cleanly to a real Postgres instance
- [x] Fixed a real bug found during verification: bare `datetime` columns defaulted
      to naive `TIMESTAMP` (no `timezone=True`), causing
      `can't compare offset-naive and offset-aware datetimes` the first time a
      loaded value was compared against `utcnow()`. Fixed at the `Base` level via
      `type_annotation_map`.
- [x] Fixed a real bug: `network_nodes` had a hard unique constraint on
      `(organization_id, agent_id)`, which made a second (historical) row for the
      same agent impossible — broke every `move_agent()` call. Replaced with a
      partial unique index (`WHERE effective_to IS NULL`).

**Seed data** (`python -m app.seed`)
- [x] 1 organization, 7 demo logins (`SUPER_ADMIN`, `ADMIN`, `BACK_OFFICE_OPERATOR`,
      `ACCOUNTING_OPERATOR`, `SALES_MANAGER`, plus a real `PROMOTER` login linked to
      agent `MD5-ROSSI` and a real `CUSTOMER` login linked to a seeded customer, so
      every dashboard is actually logins-testable, not just role-labeled)
- [x] 20 agents, 2 parallel top-level branches, 6 levels deep in Branch A —
      demonstrates branch isolation (a promoter cannot read the parallel branch)
- [x] Ranks S1–S3/TL1–4/MD1–5 (placeholder figures, see `open-questions.md`)
- [x] 3 products (luce, gas, Energia Circolare/PMI), customers of 3 kinds, contracts
      in ACTIVE / DRAFT / REJECTED / CANCELLED states
- [x] Commission ledger populated by the real engine — verified by hand: chain
      `S1(4000)→S2(+500)→S3(+500)→TL2(+1000)→TL4(+1000)→MD5(+2500)` sums correctly
      to the top rank's token, no duplicated differential

**Tests** (26 passing — pure-function + Postgres-integration, see test list below)
- [x] `apps/api/app/domains/commissions/tests/test_entrepreneurial_difference.py` —
      producer-only, single/multiple ascendants, equal/lower rank ⇒ zero,
      full S→MD chain sums correctly, empty chain
- [x] `apps/api/app/domains/commissions/tests/test_branch_cap.py` — under/at/over the
      33% cap, multiple branches, zero production, no branches
- [x] `apps/api/tests/test_auth.py` — login success, enumeration-safe failure,
      lockout after N attempts, refresh token rotation/revocation
- [x] `apps/api/tests/test_network_isolation.py` — parallel-branch isolation, closure
      depth correctness, move-agent cycle prevention, whole-subtree relocation,
      multi-tenant isolation
- [x] `apps/api/tests/test_commission_engine_integration.py` — activation generates
      the expected movements, re-processing the outbox never duplicates them,
      calculations are organization-scoped

**Frontend (Next.js 16, verified with real installs/builds)**
- [x] BFF pattern: HttpOnly/Secure/SameSite=Lax session cookie holding the API
      access+refresh tokens; browser never sees either token
- [x] `proxy.ts` (Next 16's post-middleware convention) gates `/customer`,
      `/promoter`, `/admin` behind session presence; backend still re-checks
      authorization regardless (frontend is never the security boundary)
- [x] Login page, 3 role dashboards (customer: own contracts; promoter: own agent
      profile + branch table via TanStack Table + own commissions via TanStack
      Query against a same-origin proxy route; admin: org-wide contracts +
      status breakdown)
- [x] `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm lint`, `pnpm build` all pass with zero errors

### Verification method (be explicit about what was and wasn't run)
This sandbox has no Docker daemon. To verify for real rather than trust untested
code, `postgresql`, `nodejs`/`npm`, and `pnpm` were installed directly on the host;
the backend was migrated/seeded/tested against a real local Postgres 18 instance,
and the frontend was installed/typechecked/linted/built with real `next build`.
Both servers were then started directly (`uvicorn`, `next dev`) and driven with
`curl` through the actual BFF login flow — login, cookie issuance, and all three
role dashboards were confirmed to render real server-fetched data, and
unauthenticated access to `/admin` was confirmed to redirect to `/login`.
`docker-compose.dev.yml`/`docker-compose.production.yml` were YAML-validated and
their image build steps mirror exactly what was run manually, but `docker compose
up --build` itself was not executed in this environment. Recommended first step
next session: run it in an environment with Docker to catch anything
Docker-specific (volume permissions, inter-container DNS) that manual testing
can't.

### Explicitly NOT in this session's scope (tracked for later phases)
- Payments beyond the `PaymentProvider` interface (no `MockPaymentProvider` class
  yet — the contract state machine supports the states, but there's no payment
  webhook handler in this slice)
- Document upload/storage (MinIO is wired in Docker Compose; no `documents` domain
  code yet)
- Notifications (Celery beat + outbox infra exists; no notification templates/tasks)
- Reporting/CSV export, reversals/renewals calculators (Energia Circolare bonus,
  reversal proration -- extension points documented, not implemented)
- AI/pgvector (design doc only, `docs/ai-architecture.md`)
- CI/CD pipeline, automated backup retention/off-server copy, monitoring stack
  (Prometheus/Grafana/Loki), MFA enforcement, full GDPR tooling
- Rest of the Hypothesis property-based test matrix from
  `commission-engine-specification.md`

### Known risks / assumptions
See `docs/open-questions.md`: rank thresholds, network move self-approval, Energia
Circolare formula, reversal proration formula, GDPR retention, 33% cap denominator,
MFA/lockout policy — all placeholders pending the real business-rules document.

### Next recommended session
1. Run `docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up --build` in a Docker-capable
   environment and fix anything that manual host-level testing couldn't catch.
2. Phase F: notifications (Celery tasks + templates) and a minimal reports domain.
3. Phase D hardening: `documents` domain (MinIO upload/download with signed URLs)
   and a real `PaymentProvider` + `MockPaymentProvider`.
4. Wire CI (lint/typecheck/test/build) once there's a git remote to attach it to.
