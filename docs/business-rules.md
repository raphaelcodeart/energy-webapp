# Business Rules

Status: no source document (`Allegato_A_Piano_Carriera_Regolamento_Provvigionale.pdf`)
was present in the repository at the time this was written. Every numeric threshold,
percentage and formula below is a **placeholder** used to make the system runnable and
testable. None of it should be treated as the real Lial Energy commercial policy until
confirmed. Every placeholder is also listed in `open-questions.md` with the exact
config location to change once real figures are available.

## Money

- All monetary amounts are stored as integer cents (`*_cents BIGINT`) in the database
  and as `Decimal` in Python at the API boundary. `float` is never used for money,
  percentages, or any economic quantity.
- Currency is EUR only in v1; a `currency` column exists on ledger rows for future
  multi-currency support but is not exercised.
- Rounding: half-up to the nearest cent, applied only at the point a figure is
  persisted to `commission_movements` — intermediate calculation steps keep full
  precision (`Decimal` with explicit context), see `commission-engine-specification.md`.

## Ranks / career plan (PLACEHOLDER — see open-questions.md #1)

Configured via the `ranks` table, not hardcoded. Seed values used for demo/tests:

| code | level | personal_token_cents | notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| S1 | 1 | 4000 | base seller |
| S2 | 2 | 4500 | |
| S3 | 3 | 5000 | |
| TL1..TL4 | 4-7 | 5500-7000 | Team Leader tiers |
| MD1..MD5 | 8-12 | 7500-9500 | Manager Director tiers |

`single_branch_cap_percentage` defaults to 33% for every rank (see "Regola del 33%"
below) but is per-rank, per-plan-version configurable.

### Rank promotion progress (PLACEHOLDER, added Session 15)

`personal_volume_threshold_cents` / `group_volume_threshold_cents` were present
in the schema since the very first migration but always left at 0 (never
populated, never read) until the user explicitly asked for real numbers
("procurati quei criteri qualifica e falli tu" -- go get those qualification
criteria and set them yourself) rather than leave the feature unbuilt.
Migration `0010` and `seed/ranks.py` seed the figures below; they are still a
placeholder pending the real `Allegato_A_Piano_Carriera_Regolamento_
Provvigionale.pdf` (see `open-questions.md #1`) -- reasonable, ascending,
demo-scale numbers picked by the assistant on explicit request, not confirmed
Lial Energy policy.

| code | personal_volume_threshold_cents | group_volume_threshold_cents |
|---|---|---|
| S1 | 0 | 0 |
| S2 | 1500 | 1500 |
| S3 | 3000 | 4000 |
| TL1 | 3000 | 8000 |
| TL2 | 3000 | 12000 |
| TL3 | 3000 | 16000 |
| TL4 | 3000 | 20000 |
| MD1 | 3000 | 25000 |
| MD2 | 3000 | 30000 |
| MD3 | 3000 | 35000 |
| MD4 | 3000 | 40000 |
| MD5 | 3000 | 45000 |

`GET /network/agents/{agent_id}/rank-progress`
(`commissions/services/rank_progress.py`) compares an agent's CUMULATIVE
("lifetime", not evaluated over `evaluation_window_months` -- that column
remains unused, a separate not-yet-built axis of this same placeholder)
contract value on `ACTIVE`/`RENEWED` contracts against the NEXT rank's
thresholds: `personal_volume_cents` is what the agent personally produced;
`group_volume_cents` is the same sum across their entire downline including
themselves (same descendant lookup as `get_branch_summary`). Surfaced as two
progress bars in the promoter's own "La mia Azienda" panel and in the admin's
per-promoter "Apri Rete" drill-down (same shared component). An agent already
at the top rank (no higher `level` exists for their `rule_version`) shows
"qualifica massima raggiunta" instead of a bar.

## Contract state machine

```
DRAFT → SUBMITTED → DOCUMENTS_PENDING → UNDER_REVIEW → APPROVED
      → PAYMENT_PENDING → PAID → ACTIVATION_PENDING → ACTIVE
ACTIVE → SUSPENDED → ACTIVE
ACTIVE → CANCELLED
ACTIVE → EXPIRED
ACTIVE → RENEWED
RENEWED → SUSPENDED / CANCELLED / EXPIRED / RENEWED   (a renewed contract is still
                                                        in force -- it renews again
                                                        every subsequent term, not once)
EXPIRED → RENEWED / CANCELLED                          (a lapsed contract can be revived)
any pre-ACTIVE state → REJECTED
```

Only the transitions enumerated in `apps/api/app/domains/contracts/state_machine.py`
are permitted; every other transition raises `InvalidTransitionError`. Every transition
is recorded in `contract_status_history` with actor, reason, and correlation id, and
emits a domain event (`ContractSubmitted`, `ContractApproved`, `PaymentConfirmed`,
`ContractActivated`, `ContractCancelled`, `ContractRenewed`).

**Rule**: creating a contract (`DRAFT`/`SUBMITTED`) never generates a commission.
Commissions are generated exactly once, when a contract transitions into `ACTIVE`
(see `commission-engine-specification.md §Trigger`).

**Term / expiry**: entering `ACTIVE` or `RENEWED` sets `contracts.activated_at` to
that moment and computes `contracts.expires_at` as `activated_at +
product_versions.contract_duration_months` (12 by default for an energy contract;
`NULL` for a one-off `DIGITAL`/`PHYSICAL` product with no renewal concept). Every
renewal restarts both fields from the renewal's own timestamp — `expires_at` is never
retroactively recomputed if the product version's duration later changes, matching the
"frozen at the moment it happens" pattern used for network snapshots and commission
calculations elsewhere in this document.

## Commercial network rules

- No cycles, no self-parenting, no duplicate active edges, no cross-organization
  edges. Enforced in `network` domain service before any closure-table write.
- Every move of an agent to a new parent is a single DB transaction: update
  `network_nodes.direct_parent_agent_id`, insert a closed-off `network_edges` row and
  a new one, recompute affected `network_closure` rows, insert
  `network_assignment_history`, write an audit row, invalidate branch-count caches.
  Moves require `requested_by`; `approved_by` is required unless the mover has
  `network.manage` and self-approval is explicitly allowed for that role (PLACEHOLDER —
  see open-questions.md #2).
- A contract's commercial chain is frozen at activation via `network_snapshots` /
  `network_snapshot_id` on the contract. Subsequent moves of any agent in that chain
  never retroactively change attribution, past calculations, or past ledger entries.

### New promoter suggest-then-approve workflow (added Session 17)

Every new collaborator, however they're created, only ever gets SUGGESTED --
never immediately live:

- `POST /network/agents` (an ADMIN adding a promoter anywhere in the org
  tree) and `POST /network/agents/recruit` (a promoter enrolling their own
  direct collaborator) both now create the agent with
  `status = PENDING_APPROVAL`, not `ACTIVE`.
- A `PENDING_APPROVAL` agent already exists and is visible in the network
  tree (it's a real row, a real node) but cannot be used as a contract
  producer -- `contracts/service.py::create_contract()` already rejected any
  non-`ACTIVE` producer before this feature existed, so no new guard was
  needed there; the approval workflow rides entirely on a check that was
  already correct.
- Only `network.approve` holders can turn a suggestion into a real
  collaborator: `PATCH /network/agents/{id}/approve` (→ `ACTIVE`) or `PATCH
  /network/agents/{id}/reject` (→ `TERMINATED`, with an optional reason kept
  on the row, never a hard delete). `network.approve` is granted only to
  `SUPER_ADMIN`/`ORGANIZATION_ADMIN` -- the "amministratore principale" the
  user asked for -- deliberately NOT to a plain `ADMIN`, who already holds
  `network.manage` (can suggest) but not `network.approve` (cannot confirm
  their own suggestion). Re-approving/re-rejecting an already-decided agent
  is rejected (`AgentApprovalError`), not silently accepted.
- Both creation paths and both approval outcomes fire a notification (see
  `database-model.md §7`) -- `PROMOTER_APPROVAL_REQUESTED` to every
  `network.approve` holder when something needs a decision,
  `PROMOTER_APPROVED`/`PROMOTER_REJECTED` back to the suggested agent's own
  `user_id` if they already have a login.

## Entrepreneurial Difference ("Differenza Imprenditoriale")

Defined as the difference between the personal token that a given rank would earn on a
contract and the amount already recognized to the rank(s) below it in the same
ascendant chain for that same contract. Walking the chain from the producer upward:

```
already_distributed_cents starts at producer's own personal_token_cents
for each ascendant beneficiary (by increasing distance):
    if beneficiary.rank.personal_token_cents > already_distributed_cents:
        entrepreneurial_difference_cents = beneficiary.rank.personal_token_cents - already_distributed_cents
        already_distributed_cents = beneficiary.rank.personal_token_cents
    else:
        entrepreneurial_difference_cents = 0
```

This guarantees the same differential is never paid twice up the chain — each
ascendant is only credited the marginal amount their rank adds over what has already
been recognized below them. See `commission-engine-specification.md` for the full
algorithm including the 33% cap and Energia Circolare handling.

## Commission payment tracking (added Session 16)

`commission_movements.status`/`paid_date` existed since the very first migration
but nothing ever set anything other than `ACCRUED` -- the admin dashboard's
"Provvigioni pagate" KPI always showed €0,00 because there was no code path
that could ever produce a `PAID` row. `PATCH
/commissions/movements/{id}/pay` (admin-tier only, `commissions.approve`)
is the missing write path: transitions one movement `ACCRUED -> PAID`, stamps
`paid_date`, and writes an audit row. Re-paying an already-`PAID` movement is
rejected (`CommissionPaymentError`), not silently accepted -- this is a
manual "I sent the bank transfer" confirmation per movement, not a batch
payroll run; there is no bulk-pay-everything-for-this-promoter action yet
(a reasonable next iteration once real payout batching requirements exist).

### Admin commission traceability (`GET /commissions/movements`)

Every `CommissionMovement` already had a matching `CommissionCalculationStep`
row (contract → calculation → per-beneficiary step, computed at activation
time by `run_calculation_for_contract`) carrying `rank_at_calculation`,
`base_amount_cents`, `already_distributed_cents`,
`entrepreneurial_difference_cents`, and a human-readable `explanation` string
-- none of it was ever exposed through any endpoint before this. The new
endpoint (admin-tier only -- it is org-wide, unlike `commissions.read_branch`
which `TEAM_LEADER`/`PROMOTER` also hold for their own branch, so it cannot
reuse that permission) joins all of this together per movement: which
contract, which customer, which promoter earned it, their depth below the
contract's producer (`network_snapshot_nodes.depth`, frozen at activation --
0 is the producer themselves), their rank AT calculation time vs. their rank
NOW, and the full breakdown of how the amount was derived. Surfaced in the
admin "Provvigioni" tab (`admin-commissions-panel.tsx`) as an expandable
ledger row per movement, plus `GET /commissions/movements/by-level`
(`commissions/services/admin_ledger.py::get_commission_totals_by_level`) for
the per-network-level rollup (contracts / revenue / commission generated at
each depth).

## Regola del 33%

No single first-level branch under a beneficiary may contribute more than
`single_branch_cap_percentage` (default 33%, PLACEHOLDER) of that beneficiary's
qualifying group production for rank-evaluation and volume-based bonus purposes.
Excess production from one branch beyond the cap is excluded (not moved to another
branch, not carried over) from that evaluation period's eligible total. This is
implemented as an isolated, independently testable policy —
`apps/api/app/domains/commissions/policies/branch_cap.py` — not inlined into the main
calculator, so it can be unit tested against the matrix in
`commission-engine-specification.md §33% rule test matrix` without invoking the full
engine.

## Energia Circolare (PLACEHOLDER — see open-questions.md #3)

Treated in v1 as a product flag (`products.code` / `product_versions` metadata) that
can carry its own `commission_plan_version_id`, so Energia Circolare contracts can use
different rules without touching the shared calculator code. No Energia-specific bonus
formula is implemented yet — only the extension point.

## Renewals & reversals

- A renewal is a status transition on the **same** contract row (`ACTIVE`/`EXPIRED` →
  `RENEWED`, or `RENEWED` → `RENEWED` for the year after that), not a new contract --
  see "Term / expiry" above for how `activated_at`/`expires_at` are recomputed each
  time. It is also a new `contract_events` row of type `RENEWED` plus a new commission
  calculation; it does not mutate the original calculation or its movements.
- A reversal ("storno") never deletes or edits a prior `commission_movements` row. It
  creates a new movement with `movement_type = REVERSAL`, linked via
  `commission_reversals.original_movement_id`, carrying a negative amount, an
  explanation, and the recovered period. Formula for partial-period recovery
  (PLACEHOLDER — see open-questions.md #4):
  `refund_cents = original_amount_cents * remaining_months / total_contract_months`.

## Support tickets

- Anyone opening a ticket (a `CUSTOMER` or `PROMOTER`) can only ever see and reply to
  their **own** tickets -- there is no shared inbox between a customer and the
  promoter who referred them. Staff (any admin-tier role with `tickets.respond`) sees
  every ticket in the organization and can reply to any of them.
- `Ticket.opened_by_role` and `TicketMessage.author_role` are snapshots taken at
  creation time, not derived from the user's current roles at read time -- the same
  "frozen at the moment it happens" rule used for network snapshots and commission
  calculations. A later role change never rewrites who a past ticket/message
  "belongs to".
- A staff reply on an `OPEN` ticket automatically moves it to `IN_PROGRESS` -- the
  ticket owner should see "someone is looking at this" without the admin having to
  remember a separate status update. Only staff (`tickets.respond`) can set
  `RESOLVED`/`CLOSED`; the ticket owner can only imply it's solved via a message.
- A ticket can optionally reference a `contract_id`, letting a customer or promoter
  open a ticket directly "about this contract" instead of the admin having to guess
  which one they mean from free text.

### Search, filter, and deletion (added Session 19)

- The admin ticket list (`AdminTicketsPanel`) can be filtered by opener
  (customer/promoter), category, and status, plus a free-text search over
  subject and opener name. Filtering is entirely client-side (the ticket
  list for one organization is small enough that this is simpler than
  adding query params to `GET /support/tickets`) -- if the dataset grows
  large enough to matter, move this filtering server-side rather than
  fetching the whole list.
- A ticket can be **permanently deleted only once its status is
  `RESOLVED`** (not `CLOSED` -- deliberately narrower, matching exactly
  what was asked for; revisit if `CLOSED` should also be eligible). The
  delete control (in both the ticket list row and the ticket detail view)
  is disabled for any other status, so there is no way to trigger the
  attempt from the UI on a non-resolved ticket. The backend enforces the
  same rule independently (`support/service.py::delete_ticket`, raising
  `TicketDeletionError` -> `400`) -- the frontend disabled-state is a UX
  courtesy, not the actual guard.
- Deletion always shows a confirmation dialog naming the ticket subject
  before calling `DELETE /support/tickets/{id}`; there is no direct delete
  with no confirmation step anywhere in the UI.
- Gated by a new `tickets.delete` permission, deliberately narrower than
  `tickets.respond` (granted to `SUPER_ADMIN`/`ORGANIZATION_ADMIN`/`ADMIN`
  only, not `BACK_OFFICE_OPERATOR`) -- same "narrower than the capability
  that looks like it should cover it" pattern as `network.approve` (see
  `security-model.md`), since permanently destroying a ticket is more
  consequential than replying to one.
- Deleting a ticket also deletes its `TicketMessage` rows in the same
  transaction (no FK `ondelete` cascade exists at the DB level) and
  records an audit entry (`action="ticket.deleted"`, with the subject/
  category/status snapshotted into `previous_value`) before the rows are
  removed -- the audit trail survives even though the ticket itself no
  longer does.

## Notifications (added Session 17)

See `database-model.md §7` for the table shape. Behavior:

- **Who gets what**: `CONTRACT_CREATED`/`TICKET_CREATED`/
  `PROMOTER_APPROVAL_REQUESTED` fan out to every user holding a role in a
  fixed set (`notifications/service.py::STAFF_NOTIFY_ROLES` for the first
  two, the narrower `APPROVAL_NOTIFY_ROLES` for the third -- only
  `network.approve` holders can act on an approval request, so only they
  are told about one). `COMMISSION_EARNED`/`PROMOTER_APPROVED`/
  `PROMOTER_REJECTED` go to exactly one specific user -- the beneficiary
  agent's own `user_id`, when they have a login at all (an agent with no
  `user_id` -- a collaborator who predates having their own account --
  simply generates no notification for that event, not an error).
- **The actor never notifies themselves**: whoever triggered the event
  (created the contract, opened the ticket) is excluded from that event's
  own fan-out (`notify_roles(..., exclude_user_id=actor_user_id)`) -- an
  admin creating a contract doesn't need to be told they just did that.
- **Read state is per person**: marking a notification read only affects
  the row for that recipient; a fanned-out event that reached five admins
  produces five independent rows, so one admin dismissing it doesn't
  silently clear it for the other four.
- **No push, no email** -- notifications are in-app only, polled every 25s
  by the frontend. Real-time delivery (WebSockets/SSE) and email digests are
  future work, not built here.

## Promoter reassignment

- An admin can move a customer's attribution from one promoter to another
  (`POST /customers/{id}/reassign-promoter`) -- but a customer can never end up
  with NO promoter ("nessuno può stare senza promoter che lo invita" is a closed
  circuit both at registration and afterward): reassignment is rejected if the
  customer has no existing `customer_attributions` row to correct in the first
  place (e.g. a customer created directly by admin, never through a referral
  link, has none).
- Reassigning to the SAME promoter the customer is already attributed to is
  rejected as a no-op, not silently accepted -- it would create a meaningless
  `attribution_corrections` audit row.
- Every reassignment writes an `attribution_corrections` row (previous promoter,
  new promoter, who requested it, why) -- this table existed since the first
  session's schema but had no code path writing to it until this feature.
- Reassignment only changes future commission attribution going forward; it never
  retroactively touches `network_snapshots` or past `commission_movements` for
  contracts already activated under the previous promoter (same "frozen at
  activation" rule as everywhere else commission chains are involved).

## Photo uploads

- Customer, promoter, and product photos are stored in a bucket
  (`lial-media`/`S3_BUCKET_MEDIA`) that is deliberately SEPARATE from and less
  restrictive than the documents bucket (`lial-documents`): public-read, no
  signed URLs, because these are ordinary profile/product photos, not sensitive
  documents. Never put anything sensitive in this bucket -- see
  `security-model.md §Documents`.
- Uploads are validated server-side regardless of what the browser claims:
  content-type must be one of `image/jpeg|png|webp|gif`, max 5 MB
  (`core/storage.py::upload_media()`). A new upload never overwrites the
  previous photo's object in place -- it gets a fresh random key and the
  `photo_url` column is repointed; the old object is simply orphaned (not worth
  a cleanup job for a handful of KB-sized images).
- If no photo has been uploaded, `photo_url` is `NULL` and every list/detail view
  shows a generic person icon -- never a broken `<img>` tag.

## Contract documents (added Session 14)

- Every contract requires `IDENTITY`, `FISCAL_CODE`, and `UTILITY_BILL`
  (`documents/service.py::BASE_REQUIRED_DOCUMENT_TYPES`); a customer of kind
  `COMPANY` or `CONDOMINIUM` additionally requires `CHAMBER_OF_COMMERCE`
  (`COMPANY_LIKE_KINDS`). This is a hardcoded, honest default in the service
  layer, not read from the pre-existing `product_versions.required_documents`
  jsonb column -- that column has never actually been populated or wired to
  any behavior, so treating it as configurable today would be pretending.
- `GET /contracts/{id}/documents` always returns one row per *required* type
  for that customer's kind, with `document: null` when nothing has been
  uploaded yet -- "missing" is a first-class, visible state, not silence.
- Either the customer (their own contract only) or staff can upload a
  document; only staff can review (approve/reject with a note). This covers
  both the normal flow (customer uploads, admin reviews) and the exception
  the user specifically asked for: a customer sends a document some other
  way (email, in person) and an admin uploads it into the system on their
  behalf.
- Uploading a document does not, by itself, change contract status --
  reviewing/transitioning is a separate, explicit action. The state machine's
  `SUBMITTED`/`UNDER_REVIEW` → `DOCUMENTS_PENDING` transition is how staff
  flags "this contract can't proceed until the customer completes their
  paperwork"; the transition's `notes` field is where staff records *which*
  document is missing, surfaced back to the promoter's own network view
  (`get_branch_contracts()`'s `admin_note` field) so they know what to chase.
- See `security-model.md §Documents` for how these files are stored --
  private bucket, presigned-URL-only access, never a public or guessable
  link.

## Password reset

- `POST /auth/forgot-password` always returns success regardless of whether the
  email exists for that organization -- the same enumeration-safety principle as
  login. If the account is real, a `password_reset_tokens` row is created: an
  opaque random token (only its sha256 hash persisted), expiring in 60 minutes,
  single-use (`used_at`).
- Email delivery is real SMTP when `SMTP_HOST` is configured (`core/email.py`); if
  not, the reset link is written to the API process log only
  (`docker compose logs api`) -- **never** to `audit_log` or any other place a
  web-UI role could read it, since that would let staff take over any account by
  reading its reset link. This is a genuine, working fallback, not a stub: the
  link is real and valid the moment it's generated, only its delivery channel
  differs.
- `POST /auth/reset-password` (token + new password) revokes every active session
  for that user on success -- a password reset is exactly the moment to assume the
  old password may have leaked, so anyone still logged in with it is logged out.
- Both endpoints are rate-limited per client IP (`core/rate_limit.py`, Redis
  fixed-window counter) -- 5 requests/5min for `forgot-password`, 10/5min for
  `reset-password` -- independent of the per-account lockout in `authenticate()`.

## GDPR notes

Consent versions, retention periods, and the legal basis for each processing purpose
are **not** implemented as final policy in this phase — schema hooks exist
(`documents.expires_at`, audit of all document access) but retention windows and the
lawful basis registry require legal sign-off before being treated as authoritative.
See `open-questions.md #5`.
